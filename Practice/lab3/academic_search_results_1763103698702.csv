This study investigates the depths of AI anxiety and fear among a population of information science students and professionals. Utilising a survey of over 200 current students and professionals, this study explores the connections between age, gender identity, ethnicity, geographic location, educational attainment and residence, and the levels of anxiety and fear associated with AI and the 4IR. The findings reveal nuanced relationships, with age, ethnicity, academic achievement and regional context serving as critical differentiators in 4IR and AI anxiety within this population. Students and professionals alike may benefit from seeking further education about this emerging technology.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f03912af632a587e7feafb002892265e08f84b54

At this point, there is a need to transform the negative attitudes and anxiety that may occur in nurses. Objectives It was aimed to reorganize the professional transformation in this parallel by analyzing the effect of digital leadership perception, which is explained as how nurses approach digital technologies and innovations and their awareness of how and with which methods they can use these technologies on artificial intelligence anxiety and attitude in the nursing profession. Design The study was designed as descriptive, correlational, and cross‐sectional. Participants The research was conducted by reaching 439 nurses working in hospitals operating in three different regions of Turkey by simple random sampling method. Methods In the first part of the data collection tool used in this study, digital leadership scale, artificial intelligence use anxiety, and artificial intelligence attitude scales were used, including questions determining the demographic information of nurses, their relationship with technology, artificial intelligence usage status and its importance in the profession. Results It was determined that 29.8% of the nurses had a good relationship with technology, 66.3% knew about using artificial intelligence in health, and 27.3% wanted it to be more involved in their lives. It was determined that nurses' perceptions of digital leadership were at a medium level of 46.9% and a high level of 41.7%, 82.7% had a positive attitude towards artificial intelligence, and 82.7% had low or medium level anxiety when their artificial intelligence anxiety status was examined. There was a significant and negative relationship between digital leadership and AI anxiety (r = −0.434; p < 0.01), a significant and positive relationship between digital leadership and AI attitude (r = 0.468; p < 0.01), and a significant and negative relationship between AI attitude and AI anxiety (r = −0.629; p < 0.01). Finally, it was determined that nurses' perception of digital leadership indirectly affected AI anxiety through AI attitude (β = −0.230, 95% CI [−0.298, −0.165]). Conclusion It is suggested that the anxiety and attitude towards artificial intelligence can be transformed positively with the effect of digital leadership, and in this parallel, the digital leadership phenomenon should be evaluated as a practical implementation strategy in integrating artificial intelligence into the nursing profession. Clinical Relevance Our study showed that artificial intelligence attitude has a mediating role in the indirect effect of the perception of digital leadership in nursing on AI anxiety. It was determined that nurses' digital leadership perception, artificial intelligence anxiety, and artificial intelligence attitude differed significantly with demographic variables.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fefc54822d6925abee158cecf187c5f522f5273c

With the gradual adoption of AI in EFL learning, AI anxiety has brought about a variety of issues. In order to help educators understand students’ concerns and promote the use of AI for secondary school students’ EFL learning, this study took the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and relevant aspects of AI anxiety as the theoretical foundation. Subsequently, this study analyzed the situation of AI anxiety among secondary school students and its relationship with students’ Behavioral Intention to use AI EFL learning tools. Data were collected through an online platform, with 293 valid responses from secondary school students in Beijing, China. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. The validity and reliability of the scale were satisfied with nine constructs: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Behavioral Intention, AI Learning Anxiety, Job Replacement Anxiety, Sociotechnical Blindness Anxiety, and AI Configuration Anxiety. The results indicated: (1) Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence and Facilitating Conditions could all positively predict Behavioral Intention in different degrees, and Social Influence had the strongest effect; and (2) AI Learning Anxiety and Job Replacement Anxiety might indirectly and negatively predict Behavioral Intention through intermediate variables. Based on the analysis, the study suggests that educators should not only cultivate students’ AI literacy through comprehensive AI education, but also guide students to form correct emotions through scientific psychological interventions so that they can better use AI EFL learning tools.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6230826860add82d87cc3f8722c8d702ff90829e

The present study investigated the Chinese public’s knowledge of ChatGPT, as well as examined the roles played by Big-Five personality traits, social perception, and AI anxiety in shaping the public’s attitudes toward ChatGPT using the questionnaire method. Results showed that: (1) Nearly, 1/3 of teachers surveyed did not know ChatGPT at all, and all of them were primary and secondary school teachers. (2) The level of knowledge about ChatGPT was significantly related to gender, educational level, teaching stage (in teacher samples), and major (in student samples). (3) The public’s positive attitude is higher significantly than the negative attitude. (4) Social perception positively predicted positive attitudes and negatively predicted negative attitudes. Moreover, a notably higher predictive power for positive attitudes compared to negative attitudes was demonstrated by social perception. There is an equally predictive effect of competence perception and warmth perception on attitudes, without any domain effect observed. (5) AI anxiety only positively predicted negative attitudes but did not impact positive attitudes. In explaining negative attitudes, AI anxiety exhibited a higher explanatory power compared to the Big-Five personality traits, primarily correlating with neuroticism. The findings indicate that it’s inappropriate to consider attitude evaluation toward AI as a single dimension. There are relatively independent components for positive and negative attitudes toward AI. The roles played by other predictive variables in attitudes are discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b72c37a343fc69da8d94cb2640e147b93088922d

With the pervasive integration of AI technologies across diverse domains like social media platforms, smart devices, healthcare, and education, gaining insight into how individuals perceive and engage with AI becomes essential. A sample of 197 participants (32 males, and 165 females) completed surveys assessing their levels of AI anxiety, neuroticism, and attitudes toward AI. The data were collected via Google Forms using the following structured questionnaires: Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (AIA), Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale (AIAS-4), and Neuroticism Scale. The findings indicate significant negative correlations between AI anxiety (r=-.286, p<.01), neuroticism (r=-.196, p<.01), and attitudes toward AI, suggesting that individuals with higher levels of AI anxiety and neuroticism are inclined towards adopting more skeptical viewpoints regarding AI technologies. Moreover, the AI anxiety subscales (learning, r=-.152, p<.05; job replacement, r=-.257, p<.01; sociotechnical blindness, r=-.302, p<.01, and AI configuration, r=-.256, p<.01) also showed negative significant correlations with the attitudes toward AI. At the same time, neuroticism showed significant positive correlations with the composite score of AI anxiety (r=.301, p<.01) and all its subscales (learning, r=.219, p<.01; job replacement, r=.250, p<.01; sociotechnical blindness, r=.226, p<.01, and AI configuration, r=.277, p<.01). Understanding the role of AI anxiety and neuroticism in shaping attitudes toward AI can inform the development of strategies to mitigate negative perceptions and foster more positive attitudes toward AI technologies

This study aims to measure a key aspect of this problem: the feeling of AI anxiety conveyed by news outlets that represent this technology as a sort of “alien” that is autonomous, opaque, and independent of humans. To do so, we build an AI anxiety index based on principal component analysis (PCA) and apply it to a corpus of headlines (n = 1682) about AI published before and after the launch of ChatGPT in ten newspapers: The New York Times, The Guardian, El País, Le Monde, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, San Francisco Chronicle, Manchester Evening News, La Voz de Galicia, Ouest France, and Münchner Merkur. The results show that ChatGPT not only boosted the number of AI headlines (× 5.16) but also reduced positive sentiments (−26.46%) and increased negatives (58.84%). The AI anxiety index also grew (10.59%), albeit driven by regional media (61.41%), while it fell in national media (−6.82%). Finally, the discussion of the variables that compose the index reveals the opportunities and challenges faced by national and regional media in avoiding the feeling of AI anxiety.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d23f07b766e656c24b7b3db42ad3527a4fcfab03

Focusing on ChatGPT users, it adopts the technostress framework to examine relationships between perceived AI characteristics, technostress (AI anxiety), strains (user negative attitudes), and behavioral outcomes (user discontinuous usage). Results show that (1) perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism are antecedents of AI anxiety, (2) AI anxiety influences discontinuance intentions via negative attitudes, and (3) AI anxiety mediates the link between AI characteristics and users’ psychological and behavioral responses. This study contributes to AI usage and technostress research by identifying drivers of discontinuance and deepening understanding of AI anxiety, distrust, and dissatisfaction. Findings provide actionable insights for AI designers to balance functionality with user perceptions and for policymakers to enhance AI literacy, reducing anxiety and promoting healthy AI engagement.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce683434e29fbdf37e6e44759b997e465416e198

This study explores the impact of AI on the anxiety of e-commerce professionals, establishes a structural equation model by constructing an integrated Artificial Intelligence Anxiety (AIA) framework, and analyzes the path relationships between various anxiety factors. The results show that Learning Anxiety and Job Replacement Anxiety are associated with Existential Risk Anxiety, AI Configuration Anxiety, and Sociotechnical Blindness Anxiety. The study further extends its analysis using a machine learning algorithm to assess the impact of each AIA variable and individual variables on job optimism. The results indicate that among the AIA variables, Job Replacement Anxiety has a significant negative impact on job optimism, while among the individual variables, gender has a significant negative impact.

AI does not exclude those with anxiety, especially social anxiety, over the existence of technology and all types of complexity. Several types of research have established a correlation between social and technical blindness and views toward broad AI usage. However, no specific gender or age-generation characteristics have been identified. This study employs quantitative research methodology, specifically Smart-PLS software for PLS-SEM modelling. The research included a sample of 93 lecturers, both male and female, from generations X and Y in Indonesia. The findings of this study demonstrate that social technical blindness detrimentally impacts individuals’ views toward the utilization of AI. From a gender standpoint, the path coefficients have no notable disparity. Therefore, the path coefficients for both women and men are not significantly distinct. Consequently, the need for greater awareness and understanding of AI’s social and technological aspects impacts both women and men. This research provides practical implications by enhancing instructors’ comprehension and perception of AI’s efficacy, aiming to mitigate prevailing concerns. In theory, this research enhances the concept of self-determination theory.

However, while AI technology reduces costs and enhances efficiency within healthcare institutions, it also poses a potential risk of occupational substitution for nurses, which may subsequently inhibit nurses’ innovative behavior. This study, using Mplus8.0, analyzed 394 survey responses and found the following: (1) The perceived substitution of AI technology is significantly negatively correlated with nurses’ innovation behavior (β = − 0.16, p < .001); (2) AI anxiety acts as a mediator between the perceived substitution of AI technology and nurses’ innovation behavior (β = − 0.08, p < .01); (3) Human-AI cooperation intention also acts as a mediator between the perceived substitution of AI technology and nurses’ innovation behavior (β = − 0.09, p < .001); (4) AI anxiety and human-AI cooperation intention together function as a chain mediator between the perceived substitution of AI technology and nurses’ innovation behavior (β = − 0.05, p < .05); (5) Organizational AI readiness moderates the relationship between the perceived substitution of AI technology and nurses’ innovation behavior (β = 0.05, p < .05).

Although social robots can have practical use cases where privacy concerns prevail, the use of social robots in such cases has been limited. This paper addresses this literature gap by evaluating a social robot in assessing people’s stress, anxiety, and depression via conversational AI. In this work, we develop a social robot called “Furhat” for assessment of stress, anxiety, and depression via conversational AI as an alternative to the traditional pencil and paper method. The Furhat robot is designed to interact with individuals and provide a safe and non-judgmental space for individuals to express their stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. The study compared the levels of stress, anxiety and depression assessed from Furhat with those assessed using the conventional pencil-and-paper method. Results demonstrated that the Furhat robot-based data collection and analysis method was similar to the pencil-and-paper method. Additionally, social robots were a preferred option for patients, as they reported higher levels of comfort and satisfaction with the Furhat-based screening process compared to that via the pencil-and-paper method.

A quasi-experimental design was conducted over two academic years (2023–2024) with 234 undergraduate students in a Java web application development course. Intact class sections were randomly assigned to AI-assisted pair programming (using GPT-3.5 Turbo in 2023 and Claude 3 Opus in 2024), human–human pair programming, or individual programming conditions. Data on intrinsic motivation, programming anxiety, collaborative perceptions, and programming performance were collected at three time points using validated instruments. Compared to individual programming, AI-assisted pair programming significantly increased intrinsic motivation (p < .001, d = 0.35) and reduced programming anxiety (p < .001), producing outcomes comparable to human–human pair programming. AI-assisted groups also outperformed both individual and human–human groups in programming tasks (p < .001). However, human–human pair programming fostered the highest perceptions of collaboration and social presence, surpassing both AI-assisted and individual conditions (p < .001). Mediation analysis revealed that perceived usefulness of the AI assistant significantly mediated the relationship between the programming approach and student outcomes, highlighting the importance of positive perceptions in leveraging AI tools for educational benefits. No significant differences emerged between the two AI models employed, indicating that both GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus provided similar benefits. While AI-assisted pair programming enhances motivation, reduces anxiety, and improves performance, it does not fully match the collaborative depth and social presence achieved through human–human pairing.

However, the effectiveness of AI chatbots in tackling mental health problems among the general public in Hong Kong remains unclear. Objective This study aimed to develop a local AI chatbot and compare the effectiveness of the AI chatbot with a conventional nurse hotline in reducing the level of anxiety and depression among individuals in Hong Kong. Methods This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2022 to March 2023, involving 124 participants allocated randomly (1:1 ratio) into the AI chatbot and nurse hotline groups. Among these, 62 participants in the AI chatbot group and 41 in the nurse hotline group completed both the pre- and postquestionnaires, including the GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7), PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and satisfaction questionnaire. Comparisons were conducted using independent and paired sample t tests (2-tailed) and the χ2 test to analyze changes in anxiety and depression levels. Results Compared to the mean baseline score of 5.13 (SD 4.623), the mean postdepression score in the chatbot group was 3.68 (SD 4.397), which was significantly lower (P=.008). Similarly, a reduced anxiety score was also observed after the chatbot test (pre vs post: mean 4.74, SD 4.742 vs mean 3.4, SD 3.748; P=.005), respectively. No significant differences were found in the pre-post scores for either depression (P=.38) or anxiety (P=.19). No statistically significant difference was observed in service satisfaction between the two platforms (P=.32). Conclusions The AI chatbot was comparable to the traditional nurse hotline in alleviating participants’ anxiety and depression after responding to inquiries. Moreover, the AI chatbot has shown potential in alleviating short-term anxiety and depression compared to the nurse hotline. While the AI chatbot presents a promising solution for offering accessible strategies to the public, more extensive randomized controlled studies are necessary to further validate its effectiveness.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fced734bfe36770579e68f40a73dbd144be77ad1

Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1240 primary school students aged 8–15 in Luzhou, Sichuan Province. Social anxiety was measured using the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC), learning adaptability was assessed with the Children’s Learning Adaptability Questionnaire (CSAQ), behavioral problems were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and AI tool usage was gauged through a self-developed questionnaire. Data analysis involved correlation and multiple regression analyses using SPSS, with the moderated mediation effect analyzed through Process Model 59. Results Social anxiety was found to significantly and positively predict behavioral problems, indicating that higher levels of social anxiety were associated with more behavioral problems. Learning adaptability partially mediated this relationship, suggesting that social anxiety not only directly impacts behavioral problems but also indirectly heightens the risk by reducing learning adaptability. Additionally, AI usage moderated the relationship between learning adaptability and behavioral problems, with a stronger effect of learning adaptability on behavioral problems observed at higher levels of AI usage. Specifically, the positive influence of learning adaptability on behavioral problems became more pronounced as AI usage increased, indicating that frequent AI use can amplify the impact of learning adaptability on behavioral outcomes. Conclusion Social anxiety increases the risk of behavioral problems in primary school students by diminishing learning adaptability. AI technology plays a moderating role in the relationship between learning adaptability and behavioral problems, with its effects becoming more pronounced at higher levels of AI usage. This highlights the need for educators to focus on improving students’ learning adaptability, judiciously incorporate AI technology, and consider individual differences, particularly mental health, to foster comprehensive and healthy student development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51fdd592d3c29d67064bd5515343432b4fbf4b7b

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is mainly utilized to measure stress, anxiety,
and overall mental well-being, but it is still under evaluation. This review
aims to address some of the inadequacies of current healthcare practices through
the utilization of AI technology for monitoring, diagnosing, and transforming
mental health conditions. The application of machine learning algorithms and natural
language processing techniques to assess speech, physiological indicators,
and behavioral patterns is the essence of the AI approach. These AI-based algorithms
enable the detection of subtle and often imperceptible signs of psychological
distress, which conventional clinical assessments find difficult to analyze.
The application of speech analysis to detect changes in pitch, speed, and tone
that might be connected to feelings of depression or anxiety. Similarly, sentiment
analysis and face recognition technologies are applied to textual data and
facial expressions to discern emotional states. Incorporating the importance of
ethical and privacy concerns, these AI modules potentially offer unparalleled objectivity
and accuracy in mental health assessments. AI also raises grave issues
around data security and the ethical use of personal information, as it depends
on the development of AI technologies and applications, significantly impacting
their uptake and effectiveness. The key advantage of AI is the ability to provide
ongoing, real-time mental health monitoring by offering a more flexible and dynamic
approach to mental health therapy. Overall, this article provides a comprehensive
overview of the revolutionary potential of AI in mental health assessment
by encapsulating the cutting-edge applications and considerable critical
ethical concerns to provide effective and efficient mental health treatment universally.

Effective research, however, has not been conducted to study factors influencing AI literacy. Grounded in engagement theory, self-efficacy theory, and transactional distance theory, this research investigates how anxiety, self-efficacy, and AI literacy are associated among Northern Cyprus University students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, gathering data from 222 participating students from different universities in the region. Findings indicate that for university students in Northern Cyprus, student engagement significantly influences AI literacy. Also, the relationship between student engagement and AI literacy is mediated by anxiety reduction, which denotes that higher engagement decreases anxiety, enhancing AI literacy. Moreover, it is found that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between student engagement and AI literacy, which indicates that higher levels of engagement result in higher levels of self-efficacy, resulting in higher levels of AI literacy outcomes. Smart PLS 4 structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in data analysis and gaining meaningful insight into these relationships. The study contributes to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 4 through the facilitation of mental well-being and inclusive quality education via improved AI competencies, proposing evidence-based perceptions into how engagement, anxiety reduction, and self-efficacy boost well-being and education.

This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments. A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets). Baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge retention were assessed using structured tests. Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen’s kappa to measure inter-rater reliability. AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p < 0.001). AI-generated educational materials demonstrate superior effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety compared to traditional methods.

Such systems are increasingly ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any particular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans; however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet inexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for AI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of two applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that human's ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We argue that these four properties will support practically-minded professionals to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01298v2

The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G.

These substrates must operate reliably in heterogeneous and permissionless environments, where Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls impose significant constraints. Existing solutions, however, are either designed for controlled data center deployments or implemented as monolithic systems that tightly couple machine learning logic with networking code. To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized cross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems. Lattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of NAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh. Second, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent state replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC protocol for efficient model synchronization. By integrating these components, Lattica delivers a complete protocol stack for sovereign, resilient, and scalable AI systems that operate independently of centralized intermediaries. It is directly applicable to edge intelligence, collaborative reinforcement learning, and other large-scale distributed machine learning scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00183v2

Although industry participation is an important part of the policy process, it can also cause regulatory capture, whereby industry co-opts regulatory regimes to prioritize private over public welfare. Capture of AI policy by AI developers and deployers could hinder such regulatory goals as ensuring the safety, fairness, beneficence, transparency, or innovation of general-purpose AI systems. In this paper, we first introduce different models of regulatory capture from the social science literature. We then present results from interviews with 17 AI policy experts on what policy outcomes could compose regulatory capture in US AI policy, which AI industry actors are influencing the policy process, and whether and how AI industry actors attempt to achieve outcomes of regulatory capture. Experts were primarily concerned with capture leading to a lack of AI regulation, weak regulation, or regulation that over-emphasizes certain policy goals over others. Experts most commonly identified agenda-setting (15 of 17 interviews), advocacy (13), academic capture (10), information management (9), cultural capture through status (7), and media capture (7) as channels for industry influence. To mitigate these particular forms of industry influence, we recommend systemic changes in developing technical expertise in government and civil society, independent funding streams for the AI ecosystem, increased transparency and ethics requirements, greater civil society access to policy, and various procedural safeguards.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13042v1

However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks becoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable, perception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths. By delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability in complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical concerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI echoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08804v1

Our research explores the differing explanation needs amongst stakeholders during the development of an AI-system for classifying COVID-19 patients for the ICU. We demonstrate that there is a constellation of stakeholders who have different explanation needs, not just the 'user'. Further, the findings demonstrate how the need for xAI emerges through concerns associated with specific stakeholder groups i.e., the development team, subject matter experts, decision makers, and the audience. Our findings contribute to the expansion of xAI by highlighting that different stakeholders have different explanation needs. From a practical perspective, the study provides insights on how AI systems can be adjusted to support different stakeholders needs, ensuring better implementation and operation in a healthcare context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05568v2

We consider what 'AI safety' actually means, and outline the dominant concepts that the digital footprint of AI safety aligns with. We posit that AI safety has a nuanced and uneasy relationship with transparency and other allied notions associated with societal good, indicating that it is an insufficient notion if the goal is that of societal good in a broad sense.

This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However, to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI, wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification. Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent development and deployment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08544v1

These perspectives vary both by their focus on humans or AI, and in the micro/macro lenses through which they approach subjects.

In this position paper, we propose the development of a framework AI-Mediated Exchange Theory (AI-MET) to bridge these divides.

Unlike traditional goods, content from one domain can enhance the training and performance of GenAI models in other domains. For example, OpenAI's video generation model Sora (Liu et al., 2024b) relies heavily on image data to improve video generation quality. In this work, we study nonlinear procurement mechanism design under data transferability, where online platforms employ both human creators and GenAI to satisfy cross-domain content demand. We propose optimal mechanisms that maximize either platform revenue or social welfare and identify the specific properties of GenAI that make such high-dimensional design problems tractable. Our analysis further reveals which domains face stronger competitive pressure and which tend to experience overproduction. Moreover, the growing role of data intermediaries, including labeling companies such as Scale AI and creator organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, introduces a third layer into the traditional platform-creator structure. We show that this three-layer market can result in a lose-lose outcome, reducing both platform revenue and social welfare, as large pre-signed contracts distort creators' incentives and lead to inefficiencies in the data market.

We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data, training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI. To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries, particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15680v1

In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue.

To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement.

We discuss evidence from the machine learning literature regarding the extent to which contemporary AI systems, such as language models, satisfy these conditions, finding the evidence surprisingly inconclusive. If AI systems can be considered persons, then typical framings of AI alignment may be incomplete. Whereas agency has been discussed at length in the literature, other aspects of personhood have been relatively neglected. AI agents are often assumed to pursue fixed goals, but AI persons may be self-aware enough to reflect on their aims, values, and positions in the world and thereby induce their goals to change.

Discussions of bias in AI cover much of the same conceptual terrain that sociologists studying inequality have long understood using more specific terms and theories. Concerns over reproducing societal bias should be informed by an understanding of the ways that inequality is continually reproduced in society -- processes that AI systems are either complicit in, or can be designed to disrupt and counter. The contrast presented here is between conservative and radical approaches to AI, with conservatism referring to dominant tendencies that reproduce and strengthen the status quo, while radical approaches work to disrupt systemic forms of inequality. The limitations of conservative approaches to class, gender, and racial bias are discussed as specific examples, along with the social structures and processes that biases in these areas are linked to.

Guided by the ""AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"" we evaluate these risks using ""red lines"" (intolerable thresholds) and ""yellow lines"" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&amp;D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone.

In this paper, we consider five representative avenues within the core electoral process which have potential for AI usage, and map the challenges involved in using AI within them. These five avenues are: voter list maintenance, determining polling booth locations, polling booth protection processes, voter authentication and video monitoring of elections. Within each of these avenues, we lay down the context, illustrate current or potential usage of AI, and discuss extant or potential ramifications of AI usage, and potential directions for mitigating risks while considering AI usage.

To address this gap, we design a readily-usable prototype, human\&amp;AI-assisted FE in Jupyter notebooks.

Using the prototype as a research probe, we conducted an exploratory study to gain valuable insights into data science practitioners' perceptions, usage patterns, and their potential needs when presented with feature suggestions from both humans and AI. Through qualitative analysis, we discovered that the Creator of the feature (i.e., AI or human) significantly influences users' feature selection, and the semantic clarity of the suggested feature greatly impacts its adoption rate. Furthermore, our findings indicate that users perceive both differences and complementarity between features generated by humans and those generated by AI.

Specifically, AI induced inequalities are quantified as the area between two allocation-deterioration curves. To assess the framework's performance, experiments were conducted on ten synthetic datasets (N&gt;33,000) generated from HiRID - a real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset, showing its ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to controlled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health inequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI models trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that compared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of prognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs.

In doing so, we use the work of Randall Collins and his state breakdown model to exemplify that, already today, AI based models can help synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources, reason about the world, and apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way. However, we also find that AI driven social theory remains subject to a range of practical, technical, and epistemological limitations. Most critically, existing AI systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful.

We present Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning, a promising approach in AI Safety that could substantially improve our ability to build honest artificial intelligence. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on empathy, SOO aims to align how AI models represent themselves and others. Our experiments on LLMs with 7B, 27B, and 78B parameters demonstrate SOO's efficacy: deceptive responses of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 dropped from 73.6% to 17.2% with no observed reduction in general task performance, while in Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 deceptive responses were reduced from 100% to 9.3% and 2.7%, respectively, with a small impact on capabilities. In reinforcement learning scenarios, SOO-trained agents showed significantly reduced deceptive behavior. SOO's focus on contrastive self and other-referencing observations offers strong potential for generalization across AI architectures. While current applications focus on language models and simple RL environments, SOO could pave the way for more trustworthy AI in broader domains. Ethical implications and long-term effects warrant further investigation, but SOO represents a significant step forward in AI safety research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16325v1

This creates barriers to generating music beyond the genres represented in dominant datasets such as Western Classical music or pop music. We undertook a 4 month international research project summarised in this paper to explore the eXplainable AI (XAI) challenges and opportunities associated with reducing barriers to using marginalised genres of music with AI models. XAI opportunities identified included topics of improving transparency and control of AI models, explaining the ethics and bias of AI models, fine tuning large models with small datasets to reduce bias, and explaining style-transfer opportunities with AI models. Participants in the research emphasised that whilst it is hard to work with small datasets such as marginalised music and AI, such approaches strengthen cultural representation of underrepresented cultures and contribute to addressing issues of bias of deep learning models. We are now building on this project to bring together a global International Responsible AI Music community and invite people to join our network.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13439v1

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281v2

If this powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers, then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057v1

People make decisions and usually, they need to explain their decision to others or in some matter. It is particularly critical in contexts where human expertise is central to decision-making. In order to explain their decisions with AI support, people need to understand how AI is part of that decision. When considering the aspect of fairness, the role that AI has on a decision-making process becomes even more sensitive since it affects the fairness and the responsibility of those people making the ultimate decision.

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16883v1

These applications will increase as AI capabilities continue to progress, which has the potential to be highly beneficial for society, or to cause serious harm. The role of AI governance is ultimately to take practical steps to mitigate this risk of harm while enabling the benefits of innovation in AI. This requires answering challenging empirical questions about current and potential risks and benefits of AI: assessing impacts that are often widely distributed and indirect, and making predictions about a highly uncertain future. It also requires thinking through the normative question of what beneficial use of AI in society looks like, which is equally challenging. Though different groups may agree on high-level principles that uses of AI should respect (e.g., privacy, fairness, and autonomy), challenges arise when putting these principles into practice. For example, it is straightforward to say that AI systems must protect individual privacy, but there is presumably some amount or type of privacy that most people would be willing to give up to develop life-saving medical treatments. Despite these challenges, research can and has made progress on these questions. The aim of this chapter will be to give readers an understanding of this progress, and of the challenges that remain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11068v1
